Library of common noise functions for CUDA kernels

Device functions for use in CUDA kernels which provide tools for generating procedural 3D noise.
Basis noise functions can be combined for fractional Brownian motion, as well as used to perturb
the input vector for other noise functions for turbulence effects.
